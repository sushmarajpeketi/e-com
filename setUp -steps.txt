front-end:
1.configure tailwind vite from website
2.react-router-dom
3.react-icons

Back-end:
1.install express
2.install mongoose
3.install dotenv
4.install bcryptjs
5.install jsonwebtoken

specialities:-
 *app is made responsive by tailwind using sm:hidden , md ,lg etc while styling

NewPoints:
1.react-router-dom and html 5 api history api-no full page
 rendering
2.if we make any chnages to .env file nodemon cannot catch the changes .
we need to ctrl+s the .env as well as index.js
3.add .js at the end of import files in node and not required to 
mention in react
4.by default ,json is not accepted by server ,to do so 
app.use(express.json) 
5.bcryptjs - created bcrypt for javasrcript while bcrypt is c oriented native 
library. bcryptjs.hashsync("",saltRounds) bcryptjs.compareSync(userGivenpassword,dbstoredPass)
6.JWT- transmitting json data bt client and server
    jwt.sign(payload,secretkey,options)
        payload-user-specific data
        secretkey-env variable key
        options:http-only,expiry
    jwt.verify(token, secretOrPublicKey, [options, callback])
        it returns payload if token(decoded) is verified else err is thrown
7.store.getState(),store.dispatch({type:song/add-song,payload:"new Song"})
8.*************
        try{
            
        }catch{

        }
        **the catch block willnot automatically get invoked if there is an error in 
        the data received by fetch like depending on status code 404,
        controll flow will shift to catch when there is an err in making the fetch 
        request itself,or when any unhandled promise rejections are there with in 
        the try block or any network errors.
            **we can explicitly throw err and invoke catch block by 
             if (!res.ok) {
                 // Check if the response has a non-successful status code
                throw new Error(`Response status: ${res.status}`);
                } 
        And if try block is successfully executed then it will not enter catch 
        block
